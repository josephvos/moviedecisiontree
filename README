Movie Recommendation Propositional Logic Text Bot
by Joey Vos: 811-295-117

To run the program, simply execute: python main.py

After launching, respond to each question by typing your answers exactly as prompted. Correct spelling is required for the program to proceed through the decision steps.

The program will conclude by presenting you with a movie recommendation along with the propositional logic reasoning used to generate it.

I want this program to showcase how simple it can be for people to make decision trees to showcase their data and
that anyone who can understand a template can use decision trees.
